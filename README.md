# project_repository
A repository of all the projects that I have completed recently.
Regarding any questions, please email Vishnu.Duriseti@colorado.edu

1) DND Project
This project is pretty in depth and is briefly described on my resume, if running please compile using the following in terminal (for windows - tested in vscode)
Compile: g++ -std=c++17 .\DungeonEscapeDriver.cpp .\Character.cpp .\Inventory.cpp .\Item.cpp .\Map.cpp .\Monster.cpp .\split.cpp .\allMenus.cpp .\InvenMap.cpp .\sortingAlgorithm.cpp -o DungeonEscape Run: ./DungeonEscape.exe

2) Rocket Calibration
This project might not have as many functions as the others, but is mathematically more complex. It is a model through MATLAB of the regression of voltage to thrust that a load-sensor would pick up, and uses this regression to calculate the thrust over time of around 10 static fires of some model rockets.

3) Online Chatting Databse
This is a text-based UI online chatting database. Please run the file buffchatdriver.cpp as this is the driver for the whole program!
