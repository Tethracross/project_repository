This is the Repository for a project consisting of calculating the regression model for a thrust test in ASEN 2012.

Things to note: I did not collect the data that was programmed into this MATLAB Model, I was given this data to test my capabilites. However I wanted to include this in the repository as it shows my analytical skills in processing and analyzing data and its accuracy for engineering-related purposes. Please reach out to me with any questions at Vishnu.Duriseti@colorado.edu
